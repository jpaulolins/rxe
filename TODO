SHORT TERM TO-DOs
=================

- Make an unit test
- Write API documentation
- Implement missing things: POSIX character classes, \o, \g with negative
  and named backreferences, \k, etc.
- Add flag to change associativity direction
- Code refactoring
  > split handle_repeats in two functions: the first parses/validates
    the paramaters, the second does the actual work
  > simplify the ? quantifier using the above function as a special case {0,1}
- Performance
  > add binary tree to speed up regexes with large number of alternations
  > Clean up error handling code
  > More descriptive error messages pointing to the probable location

LONG-TERM TO-DOs
