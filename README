This is librxe version 0.9, a library to enumerate sets described by
regular expressions. It comes with a demo program called 'rxenum'.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=========================

1. Dependencies:

   You need the GNU MP multiprecision arithmetic library.
   Under Debian/Ubuntu, you can easily have it by doing (as root):

       apt-get install libgmp3-dev
       
   You you also need gcc, ar and make. You can have them by doing (as root):
   
       apt-get install build-essential make

2. In the top-level directory, type:

       make

3. If you get no errors, test with:

       ./rxenum '[A-Z]{8}'

   The program should respond with:
   
        208.827.064.576
        ~ 10^11.3198
        ~  2^37.6035
        
   Which means there are about 208 billion strings composed of eight
   characters from A to Z.

4. Install the program and its manual page, running (as root):

        make install

5. Read the fine manual:

        man rxenum
